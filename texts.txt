Storme: There's a fire burning
Octa: And I breathe
Storme: Through the rolls that the millions of hollering hollow folk know how to play
Octa: Tomorrow's jokes have yet to be laughed at or said
Storme: They're just shadows searching for light
Octa: My head's not yours it's mine
Storme: To that last good man grace
Octa: You're better than this
Storme: I can't do this
Octa: you can
Storme: You're not a coward 'cause you cower
Octa: You're brave because they broke you
Storme: Yet broken still you breathe
Octa: So breathe, breathe, just breathe
Storme: 'Cause I'm not trapped with you, you see, you're the one who's trapped with me
Octa: Sometimes I fall to pieces just to see what bits of me don't fit
Storme: 'Cause I when I stand oh those folks will run and tell the tales of what I've become
Octa: They'll speak of me, oh in whispered tones and say my name like it shakes their bones
Storme: But now I'm leading, doesn't that just scare you to death?
